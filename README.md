## Football Match Results Prediction
This project aims to predict the results of soccer matches using machine learning techniques. More than 100,000 data corresponding to regular season matches from 52 soccer leagues around the world over 20 seasons were analyzed.

## Project Process
The project was divided into the following stages:

- Data Cleaning: An exhaustive cleaning of the data was carried out to eliminate incorrect, duplicate or missing records. In addition, necessary transformations were carried out to prepare the data for further analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: An exploratory data analysis was performed to obtain information on the characteristics and distributions of the variables. This included visualizations and descriptive statistics to better understand the data.

- Creation of New Variables: New variables were created based on the available data. For example, historical performance indicators were calculated for each team, such as average goals scored, average goals conceded, among others.

- Calculation of a Ranking for Each Team: An algorithm was implemented to calculate a ranking for each team based on their historical performance. This allowed us to have an objective measure of the performance of each team based on their previous results.

- Machine Learning Modeling: Machine learning techniques were used to predict the results of the matches. Different algorithms were tested, such as logistic regression, recurrent convolutional neural networks (CNN-LSTM) and classification models based on decision trees.

- Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall and accuracy. In addition, a confusion matrix was created to visualize the results of the predictions.

- Model Improvement: Model adjustments were made and different techniques to improve performance were explored. For example, the hyperparameters were modified, the inclusion of more variables was tested, or a larger training data set was used.

## Results and conclusions
Throughout the project, it was possible to develop a model for predicting the results of football matches with a significant level of precision. Although no model is perfect, the results obtained demonstrated the usefulness of machine learning techniques in predicting sports results.

This project can be useful for soccer fans, bookmakers and others interested in predicting the results of matches. However, it is important to note that the predictions are based on historical data and do not take into account unpredictable factors or constantly changing variables.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for further research and improvements in football match outcome prediction using machine learning techniques.
